    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    <value>Oohhh.
Jedi Master.
Yoda.
You seek Yoda.
Mmm.
Take you to him, I will.
Yes, yes.
But now, we must eat.
Come.
Good food.
Come.
Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well.
Eat, eat.
Hot.
Good food, hm?
Good, hmm?
Not far.
Yoda not far.
Patience.
Soon you will be with him.
Rootleaf, I cook.
Why wish you become Jedi?
Hm?
Ah, your father.
Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.
I cannot teach him.
The boy has no patience.
Hmmm.
Much anger in him, like his father.
Hah.
He is not ready.
Ready, are you?
What know you of ready?
For eight hundred years have I trained Jedi.
My own counsel will I keep on who is to be trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
This one a long time have I watched.
All his life has he looked away... to the future, to the horizon.
Never his mind on where he was.
Hmm?
What he was doing.
Hmph.
Adventure.
Heh! Excitement.
Heh! A Jedi craves not these things.
You are reckless!
He is too old.
Yes, too old to begin the training.
Will he finished what he begins?
Oh, you will be.
You will be.
Run! Yes.
A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
But beware of the dark side.
Anger... fear... aggression.
The dark side of the Force are they.
Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight.
If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
No... no... no.
Quicker, easier, more seductive.
You will know.
When you are calm, at peace.
Passive.
A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.
No, no, there is no why.
Nothing more will I teach you today.
Clear your mind of questions.
Mmm.
Mmmmmmmm.
That place... is strong with the dark side of the Force.
A domain of evil it is.
In you must go.
Only what you take with you.
Your weapons... you will not need them.
Use the Force.
Yes...
Now... the stone.
Feel it.
Concentrate!
So certain are you.
Always with you it cannot be done.
Hear you nothing that I say?
No! No different! Only different in your mind.
You must unlearn what you have learned.
No! Try not.
Do.
Or do not.
There is no try.
Size matters not.
Look at me.
Judge me by my size, do you?
Hm?
Mmmm.
And well you should not.
For my ally in the Force.
And a powerful ally it is.
Life creates it, makes it grow.
Its energy surrounds us and binds us.
Luminous beings are we... not this crude matter.
You must feel the Force around you.
Here, between you... me... the tree... the rock... everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that ship!
That is why you fail.
Concentrate... feel the Force flow.
Yes.
Good.
Calm, yes.
Through the Force, things you will see.
Other places.
The future... the past.
Old friends long gone.
Hmm.
Control, control.
You must learn control.
Mmm.
Friends you have there.
It is the future you see.
Difficult to see.
Always in motion is the future.
Decide you must how to serve them best.
If you leave now, help them you could.
But you would destroy all for which they have fought and suffered.
Luke! You must complete the training.
You must not go!
Yes, yes.
To Obi-Wan you listen.
The cave.
Remember your failure at the cave!
Stopped they must be.
On this all depends.
Only a fully trained Jedi Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor.
If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path, as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.
If you honor what they fight for... yes!
Strong is Vader.
Mind what you have learned.
Save you it can.
Told you, I did.
Reckless is he.
Now matters are worse.
No.
There is another.
Hmm.
That face you make.
Look I so old to young eyes?
I do, yes, I do! Sick have I become.
Old and weak.
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not.
Hmm?
Soon will I rest.
Yes, forever sleep.
Earned it, I have.
Strong am I with the Force... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night must fall.
That is the way of things... the way of the Force.
No more training do you require.
Already know you that which you need.
Ohhh.
Not yet.
One thing remains: Vader.
You must confront Vader.
Then, only then, a Jedi will you be.
And confront him you will.
Mmm... rest I need.
Yes... rest.
Your father he is.
Told you, did he?
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...
No.
Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your training.
Not ready for the burden were you.
Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
But beware.
Anger, fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.
Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your father's fate, you will.
Luke, when gone am I, the last of the Jedi will you be.
Luke, the Force runs strong in your family.
Pass on what you have learned, Luke... There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.</value>
